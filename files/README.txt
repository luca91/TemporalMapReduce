data-seq-nnk: sequential tuples, i.e., the timestamps of the tuples are disjoint.
data-equal-nnk: all tuples have the same timestamp.
data-random-nnk: start time and duration of the tuples are uniformly distributed.
data-worst-nnk: all start and end points are different, and there is a time interval (in the middle) where all tuples hold.
